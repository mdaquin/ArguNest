The sense of it I have already explained, and made to be the same with what the letter of the
text imports; namely, That our whole affection be placed upon God, and that we love him so
entirely as to love none but him. I come now to justify this sense, which I shall endeavour to
establish upon this double basis in general.
I. THAT God is the only author or cause of our love.
II. THAT he is also the only proper object of it.
</p>
<p class="al_text">
[…] Well then, we have now at length found out the true cause of all our pleasure, and in that
the only proper object of our love. And certainly, if ever philosophy were a handmaid to
divinity, it is now, as furnishing us with a certain ground for the most sublime and noble
conclusion in the world, the full, perfect and entire love of God, which now appears to be
founded upon principles, and to be demonstrable in a clear and distinct order of reasoning.
For if God be the only true cause that acts upon our spirits, and produces our pleasure, then
he only does us good, he only perfects our being and makes us happy; and if he only does us
good, then he only is our good; and if he only is our good, then he only is lovely, or the
proper object of our love; and if he only is lovely, then ’tis plain that we ought to love none
but him, and him entirely. Or to argue backwards, we are to love nothing but what is lovely;
nothing is lovely but what is our Good; nothing is our Good, but what does us good; nothing
does us good but what causes Pleasure in us; nothing causes Pleasure in us but God; therefore
we are to love nothing but God. I say nothing but God, for he is the only lovely Object, and
he is infinitely so. Nothing but God, for he only is our Good. Nothing but God, for he only
does us good and makes us happy. Nothing but God, for he only is the author of all our
pleasure; and in him we not only live, move and have our being, but have also all the joy and
comfort of our being. Whatever degree of good we have received, we have received it of him;
whatever we enjoy, we enjoy it in him; and whatever we expect, we expect it from him, with
whom is the Well of Life, [Book of Psalms 36. 9.] And in whose light we hope to see light;
and therefore we are to love none but him, and him with the whole heart, soul, and mind,
with the full weight of our desire, with all the activity of our love.
      </p>
      <p class="al_text">
[…] If it should now be objected (as ’tis very probable it may) that the enlarging this first
commandment to such a magnitude, will make it devour and swallow up the second. For if
the love of God must be thus perfect and entire, so as to be exclusive of all creatures [i.e.
human beings], what room can then be left for the love of our neighbour? To this the answer
is very easy and very clear. If our love to God and our neighbour were of the same kind, the
entire love of the former would indeed wholly exclude that of the latter. But this is not the
case. We are not here supposed to love God in the same sense, or with the same sort of love
wherewith we love our neighbour. We do not love God by wishing any good to him (whereof
he is not capable) but by wishing him as a good to ourselves. On the contrary, we do not, or
at least should not love our neighbour by wishing him as a good to ourselves, (for he is not
our good) but by wishing good to him. That is in short, we love God with love of desire, and
we love our neighbour with love of benevolence or charity. But now the entire desire of God
is very consistent with all manner of benevolence to our neighbour. It does indeed wholly
exclude all love of desire towards him. But this is what I contend for, I would have the love
